        A storm was looming. The sky was becoming ever darker, slowly hiding the still persistent sunlight, which was still shining
        its orange rays over Bald Mountain.<br />
        <br /> Geralt&rsquo;s cat eyes focused on the path ahead. He was here with one goal. <br />
        <br /> Kill the Elf. Avenge Vesemir.<br />
        <br /> And yet, just before the upcoming fight, there was an idea in his mind that shouldn&rsquo;t be there. What
        if he lost?<br />
        <br /> Somewhere below his feet, Ciri was on her way to the Crones.<br />
        <br /> What if she lost too?<br />
        <br /> He shouldn&rsquo;t think about this, he should only think about succeeding in his goal.<br />
        <br /> It was a folk&rsquo;s legend that the Witcher Trials had rid the Witchers of their emotions, they were just
        suppressed.<br />
        <br /> Right now?<br />
        <br /> Right now, Geralt felt hate. Anger. A strong determination to revenge his mentor, Vesemir, who had taught
        him everything he knew.<br />
        <br /> He checked his belt one more time. He had all his utility with him.<br /><br />Hell was about to break loose.<br
        />
        <br /> Geralt&rsquo;s hand faintly touched the rocks to his right as he rounded the corner. The scene unfolded in
        front of him. <br />
        <br /> Imlerith on a stone throne, surrounded by Succubi - he&rsquo;d have to try and get them out of here. <br />
        <br /> Flat, even ground - perfect for quick maneuvers.<br />
        <br /> Geralt looked at Imlerith. The helmet had been put off, one of the Succubi was holding it in front of her
        face, giggling a bit. Imlerith himself looked at Geralt, a mean smile playing around his mouth. The red paint on
        his face accentuated the deep eyes.<br />
        <br /> As Geralt approached, the Succubi moved out of the way immediately, and Imlerith raised himself a bit, still
        sitting on his throne. <br />
        <br /> &ldquo;The sisters said you&rsquo;d come,&rdquo; he spoke in a deep voice. &ldquo;They saw you arrive in the
        water&rsquo;s surface.&rdquo; <br />
        <br /> He leant forward slightly. &ldquo;They did not see the girl - but she is with you, is she not?&rdquo;<br />
        <br /> Heavy accent on those last words - he knows, Geralt realised, and slowly bringing his hand to his silver sword
        (glyphed by an Ofieri merchant), he said, &ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;<br />
        <br /> Metal armour clanked as Imlerith rose from his throne. <br />
        <br /> &ldquo;First you - then her,&rdquo; he said as he grabbed his helmet and put it on. He twisted his large steel
        mace in his hands as he grabbed his shield - now completely ready for the ensuing battle.<br />
        <br /> Geralt drew his sword and cast a Quen sign to wait for Imlerith&rsquo;s first move - which came quicker than
        he expected. <br />
        <br /> Imlerith thrusted his mace forward and Geralt managed to dodge just in time, but the mace hit the Quen shield
        and it was broken all the same. He positioned his sword for a thrust in the elbow pit, but Imlerith had already turned
        to face the thrust and it bounced off against the large Elven shield.<br />
        <br /> The mace swung towards Geralt and he rolled underneath it, getting in a strike against Imlerith&rsquo;s left
        thigh as he stood back up and cast another Quen sign - but immediately Imlerith&rsquo;s shield collided hard with
        Geralt and the Quen shield broke again.<br />
        <br /> Geralt staggered slightly and rolled away as the mace almost hit him - but now Geralt was ready. As Imlerith
        thrust the mace forward once more, Geralt dodged towards the left and cast an Aard sign. The wind blast brought Imlerith
        just a bit out of balance - the exact gap Geralt was trained from a young age to exploit.<br />
        <br /> He thrust precisely, just below the rib cage, and the Aard that emitted from the Glyph blew off a piece of
        armour. Imlerith growled and swung his shield towards Geralt to knock him over, but Geralt was faster. He rolled
        underneath the shield again and now threw a slash at the leg of the Elf and Imlerith stumbled.<br />
        <br /> &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay for this!&rdquo; he roared, and he swung his mace again, right at Geralt&rsquo;s head.
        Geralt ducked and cast a Quen, and swung his sword again at Imlerith&rsquo;s leg - but out of nowhere, Imlerith&rsquo;s
        shield collided with Geralt and despite the Quen, he was thrown off balance and rolled towards the cliff, and for
        a few seconds, he lay there, groaning. <br />
        <br /> Imlerith closed in, breathing heavily. &ldquo;Stand up Witcher, stand up and fight, and die the death every
        Witcher has died!&rdquo; <br />
        <br /> For just a moment, Geralt saw Vesemir, teaching him everything he knew, taking care of Ciri, patiently trying
        to understand Uma - he saw Vesemir dying at Imlerith&rsquo;s hands, his neck snapped in one movement.<br />
        <br /> New energy flowed through his veins, and Geralt rose up from the ground, his silver sword held tighter than
        ever.<br />
        <br /> With a roar, Imlerith thrust forward again, but Geralt simply dodged. Another swing - Geralt stepped backward
        and avoided that one too. But Imlerith continued, the momentum of the steel mace not stopping, and swung it down.
        Geralt raised his sword and with an intense clang, steel and silver collided.<br />
        <br /> Imlerith slowly pushed further downward and Geralt sunk a bit lower through his knees - but then he felt it
        again, that single exploitable gap. With new-found strength, he slowly pushed Imlerith&rsquo;s mace out of the way
        until the Elf&rsquo;s intestines were exposed - within seconds, Geralt had cast an Aard and Imlerith&rsquo;s mace
        fell onto the ground, a few metres away. <br />
        <br /> Geralt reversed his sword and thrust precisely in the earlier created gap in Imlerith&rsquo;s armour, the
        emitted Aard sign blowing off even more armour, and Geralt&rsquo;s sword went all the way through.<br />
        <br /> With a roar, Imlerith raised his fists and slammed Geralt&rsquo;s sword out of the way, the blood accentuating
        the glowing Glyphs. In one motion, he grabbed Geralt by the throat and raised him into the air.<br />
        <br /> &ldquo;Who taught you to fight like this?&rdquo; he growled, slowly walking forward towards the ravine. But
        Geralt didn&rsquo;t feel fear - his hands were free. He glared right back at Imlerith and raised his hand.<br />
        <br /> &ldquo;The Witcher you slew,&rdquo; he said, and cast a perfect and persistent Igni at Imlerith&rsquo;s head.
        Imlerith roared in pain and agony, releasing Geralt and falling onto his knees, still bleeding heavily. <br />
        <br /> Slowly, he pulled off his helmet, glowing pure red from the heat. His face was horribly disfigured, there
        was no skin left. There was just the smoking flesh.<br />
        <br /> Panting, Geralt picked up the mace and dragged it towards Imlerith. <br />
        <br /> Right now? <br />
        <br /> Right now, Geralt felt hate. Pure anger. And with the strength he had left, he raised the mace into the air
        and connected with Imlerith&rsquo;s head, crushing it - finally achieving revenge.<br /><br /> - written by &copy; Edwin
